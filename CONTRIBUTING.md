# Contributing

This file will guide you through the process of getting to project up and running, in case you want to provide coding contributions.

You will also see how to ensure the code fulfills the expected code checks, and how to create a pull request.

## System dependencies

The project can be run inside a docker container through provided `docker compose` configuration.

Because of this, the only actual dependencies are [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Setting up the project

The first thing you need to do is fork the repository, and clone it in your local machine.

Then you will have to follow these steps:

* Copy the file `docker-compose.override.yml.dist` by also removing the `dist` extension.
* Start-up the project by running `docker compose up`.

Once this is finished, you will have the project exposed in port `3000` (http://localhost:3000).

## Project structure

This project is a [react](https://reactjs.org/) & [redux](https://redux.js.org/) application, built with [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which is distributed as a 100% client-side progressive web application.

This is the basic project structure:

```
shlink-web-client
├── config
├── public
├── scripts
├── src
├── test
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

* `config`: It contains some configuration scripts, used during testing, linting and building of the project.
* `public`: Will act as the application document root once built, and contains some static assets (favicons, images, etc).
* `scripts`: It has some of the CLI scripts used to run tests or building.
* `src`: Contains the main source code of the application, including both web components, SASS stylesheets and files with logic.
* `test`: Contains the project tests.

## Running code checks

> Note: The `indocker` shell script is a helper used to run commands inside the docker container.

* `./indocker npm run lint`: Checks coding styles are fulfilled, both in JS/TS files as well as in stylesheets.
* `./indocker npm run lint:js`: Checks coding styles are fulfilled in JS/TS files.
* `./indocker npm run lint:css`: Checks coding styles are fulfilled in stylesheets.
* `./indocker npm run lint:js:fix`: Fixes coding styles in JS/TS files.
* `./indocker npm run lint:css:fix`: Fixes coding styles in stylesheets.
* `./indocker npm run test`: Runs unit tests with Jest.
* `./indocker npm run mutate`: Runs mutation tests with StrykerJS (this command can be very slow).

## Building the project

The source code in this project cannot be run directly in a web browser, you need to build it first.

* `./indocker npm run build`: Builds the project using a combination of `webpack`, `babel` and `tsc`, generating the final static files. The content is placed in the `build` folder, which is automatically created if it does not exist.
* `./indocker npm run serve:build`: Serves the static files inside the `build` folder in port 5000 (http://localhost:5000). Useful to test the content built with previous command.

## Pull request process

In order to provide pull requests to this project, you should always start by creating a new branch, where you will make all desired changes.

The base branch should always be `main`, and the target branch for the pull request should also be `main`.

Before your branch can be merged, all the checks described in [Running code checks](#running-code-checks) have to be passing. You can verify that manually, or wait for the build to be run automatically after the pull request is created.
